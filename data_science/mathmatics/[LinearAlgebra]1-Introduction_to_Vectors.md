## 1. Introduction to Vectors

### 1. Vectors and Linear Combinations 벡터와 선형결합
- Column vector
	- vector addition
	- scalar multiplication
- Linear Combinations
- Vectors in Three Dimensions
- The Important Questions
	1. What is the picture of all combinations \\(cu\\)?
	2. What is the picture of all combinations \\(cu\\) + \\(dv\\)?
	3. What is the pciture of all combinations \\(cu\\) + \\(dv\\) + \\(cw\\)?

</br>

- **Review of the Key Ideas**
	1. A vector \\(v\\) in two-dimensional space has two components \\(v_1\\) and \\(v_2\\)
	2. \\(v+w = (v_1+v_2+v_3+v_4\\) and \\(cv=(cv_1,cv_2\\) are found a component at a time.
	3. A linear combination of three vectors \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) and \\(w\\)is \\(cu+dv+ew\\).
	4. Take \\(all\\) linear combinations of \\(u\\), or \\(u and v\\), or \\(u,v,w\\). In three dimensions, those combinations typically fill a line, then a plane, and the whole space \\(R^3\\).

### 2. Lengths and Dot products





### 3. Matrices (Matrix의 복수형)
